Notes:

Noting that in your README you've got node 16. Node 16 was end of support Sep 2023, so with that comes issues with compatibility and therefore vulnerabilities. 
I would recommend updating Node and also I would ask about the general strategy for keeping node package dependencies up to date on a regular basis
(This can be done with dependabot reviews for example, typically done as per a SOC2-type 1 or 2 certification). 

I used nvm to swap down to the old version of node.

In terms of upgrading packages and node versions I'm going to consider that out of the scope of this test but I am happy to 
discuss how I would go about doing this as it is something  I do regularly in my current position.
